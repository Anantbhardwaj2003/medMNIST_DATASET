# About Dataset
THE DATASET IS NOT INTENDED FOR CLINICAL USE

# Data
A set of pixel arrays representing images of various sizes, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 224x224.
The data set was taken from the website https://medmnist.com / for educational purposes, to quickly download data to kaggle laptops.
Based on these sets, deep convolutional image classification models are demonstrated.
This upload contains the data from OrganMNIST and BloodMNIST
